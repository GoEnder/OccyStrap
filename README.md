===========


What is OccyStrap
-----------

OccyStrap is a piece of Java software that allows a user to link multiple Minecraft servers together, Giving players the ability to teleport and travel from one to the other.  
This makes it perfect for servers looking to distribute the load on their servers or include multiple conflicting gamemodes.  




History
-----------
OccyStrap is based off of BungeeCord, Originally created by @md_5  
We've created OccyStrap to improve upon BungeeCord and create changes we felt were nessisary to make.  




Installation and Usage
-----------
A guide for BungeeCord installation and usage is [avaliable here](http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/bungeecord.392/)  
It might not be an exact guide due to the changes we have made in OssyStrap, our own guide is coming soon
